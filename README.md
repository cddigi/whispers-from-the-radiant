## 📖 About the Game

The Prime Radiant has detected a critical divergence in the Seldon Plan. As rival Second Foundation mentalics, you each receive different whispered calculations from the Prime Radiant. Through 13 tricks representing probability nodes in psychohistory, you must prove your interpretation will best resolve the crisis.

But beware the paradox of power: winning too many tricks (10-13) reveals your manipulation and voids your calculations, scoring zero points. The most subtle influence wins.

### Game Features

- **Mental Shields**: Cards are hidden behind psychohistorical equations until revealed
- **Hold-to-Reveal**: Press and hold to temporarily pierce your opponent's mental shield
- **Special Abilities**: Six unique card powers that alter the flow of play
- **Character Abilities**: Each player receives a unique Foundation character with special powers
- **Game Clock**: Track the duration of your psychohistorical calculations
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - Local multiplayer (pass-and-play with auto-switching)
  - Single player vs intelligent AI Mentalic
- **Enhanced AI**: Strategic opponent that understands scoring zones and uses abilities
- **Foundation Theme**: Deep integration with Asimov's Second Foundation concepts

### Scoring (The Subtlety Paradox)

| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| 4          | 1      | **Detected** - Your touch was noticed                      |
| 5          | 2      | **Obvious** - Resistance builds                            |
| 6          | 3      | **Contested** - Equations in flux                          |
| 7-9        | 6      | **Calculated** - Mathematical perfection                   |
